In contrast to CPUs, which have few but powerful cores, GPUs have many more specialized cores, making them ideal for workloads that can be parallelized into simpler tasks. Nowadays, one such workload is deep learning, where GPUs can easily accelerate inference of neural networks by splitting operations across multiple cores.\n",
